    * Use the following command to clone the repository:

        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/your-username/iSort.git](https://github.com/your-username/iSort.git)
        ```

2.  **Download as ZIP (Alternative):**

    * Go to the GitHub repository page: [https://github.com/your-username/iSort.git](https://github.com/your-username/iSort.git)
    * Click on the "Code" button (usually green).
    * Select "Download ZIP".
    * Save the ZIP file to your computer and extract it to your desired location.

3.  **Open the `index.html` file:**

    * Locate the `index.html` file in the extracted folder or cloned repository.
    * Open it in your web browser by:
        * Double-clicking the file,
        * Right-clicking and selecting "Open with" and choosing your browser, or
        * Using the command line (e.g., `open index.html` on macOS, `start index.html` on Windows).
